# EliteHomes - A Modern Real Estate Template 🏠

This project is a complete and responsive landing page for a fictional real estate company called "EliteHomes." This template was designed as a training project for front-end beginners, with a specific focus on mastering the use of the **Bootstrap 5** framework.

**Note for the Developer (Beginner):** This is my second project using Bootstrap, and I am learning and applying concepts of responsive design and front-end best practices. Any feedback or suggestions for code improvement are highly welcome!
